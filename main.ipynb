       "[Document(page_content=\"I want to welcome everybody to Let's Talk,\\nICT. This has been an ongoing series this year\\nwhere we talk about different aspects of access with electronic documents and access to things\\nthat are put up on the web. In today's session we're talking about doing\\nit yourself captioning for a video file and, and putting it up on places like; Facebook\\nor YouTube or Vimeo or even maybe on a website. And I'm gonna go through just a couple things\\nif you're new to our session. Typically we hold questions and answers till\\nthe end and so you'll see that you've been muted. You can leave questions in the caption I mean\\nin the chat box if you'd like. And we'll scroll through that. We will also, this day is different than the\\nother sessions, we are doing a raffle at the end for those of you participating today. I have, if you can see here, I have a little\\nbox. And I'm going to be writing everybody's name\\ndown on these little pieces of paper and I will be pulling one of those names out at\\nthe end and the winner will receive a robotic pet. We have these really neat devices in our agency\\nthat responds to touch and movement. And so it'll be a fun little piece of assistive\\ntechnology for you to win! So um let's move on to the next slide and\\nI'd like to introduce today, I'm Eileen Belton by the way with Missouri Assistive Technology. I'm a program coordinator here in our agency. We also have a special guest presenter today\\nwho's Carrie Logback. She's a professional Captioner. She has her own business called CCC Services\\nand today we're just very fortunate and blessed to have her talk to you a little bit about\\nthe captioning tool that she wants to share with you and about captions and how to do\\nthat.  Captioning is important if you upload a video\\nfile on any of those platforms that I've mentioned earlier. It must be captioned. It is a requirement and, and it really, it's,\\nit's smart for two reasons. When you obviously increase access to an individual\\nthat is deaf or hard of hearing you, and also you expand your audience for those that for\\nexample on a Facebook app somebody might be scrolling through. And if your video pops up and they have all\\nthe um their sound muted, their media sound option is muted, they won't hear a thing that's\\non your video. The chances of them dwelling longer in your\\nvideo because you have captions, go up tremendously. And so that's another benefit to adding captions. Obviously not the main reason why we're talking about it today because access is primary. But it does help you if you are working with\\na customer base. The things you want to know about captioning\\nwhen you're doing it yourself, um are basically these things we have listed you. And when you're captioning you'll need to\\nidentify the speaker if there's more than one. You identify when the, the speaking changes\\nto another person. And in the video that we'll show this morning\\nyou'll see an example of that. It's very simple um you'll also want to, as\\nyou're doing your own captions edit them. Um there, there is a distinct difference when\\nsomebody uses an auto-generated option that's left unedited versus when a person's hand\\nis on it. That's um capitalized names and capitalize\\nthe agency or business name and also caught mispronunciations. Editing makes a difference. Captioning should also capture atmosphere\\nsounds. For example, if it's a video of um say, a\\nnew bakery is opened up, and the newscaster is um there at the bakery sampling a piece\\nof a delicacy that's been made for them. And the expected outcome is going to be that\\nthey're delighted and it's very good. What if all of a sudden when they're taking\\na bite and the close-up is on them, and there's something that's going on that you don't know\\nwhat's happening, and they make a horrible face. Um if there's a sound that influenced that\\nface you'll want to know that, otherwise you'll assume that what they tasted was not very\\ngood. So um this is a simple silly example but,\\natmosphere sounds explain what's going on in the video. But it also is all-inclusive. You include them in everything that's happening\\nin your video, Um Captions! The transcript should also be timed with the\\nspeaking and so there is a timing piece that you'll be able to adjust on some of the tools\\nwe're talking about today. And the other thing about captioning is what\\nappears on the line should be a few lines at a time and Carrie will reference an amount\\nto you in the video. So those are basics on captioning. I'm going to turn it over now to Carrie and\\nshe'll talk with you a little bit about the tool she uses. And Carrie I'm going to go ahead and turn\\nit over to you. [Carrie]- Thanks Eileen. [Eileen}- You're welcome. [Carrie]- And I’m seeing that gray box on\\nyour slide. I don't know if you maybe have captions on. I'm seeing a couple of gray boxes over the\\nslides. Maybe I'm the only one but in any event, thank\\nyou for uh inviting me to help you present today. And Eileen has done a lot of legwork on and\\nshe will demonstrate to you, how to utilize YouTube and even Facebook, their sort of auto-captioning\\nand auto-sync features. They've really come a long way, especially\\nin the past year. It used to be that I would provide a text\\nfile of something that I had captioned to a client who would upload it to YouTube. And they would let YouTube auto-sync that\\ntext to the YouTube video for captions. And sometimes it worked and sometimes it wouldn't. Sometimes that auto-sync just for whatever\\nreason, if there's song lyrics or someone, had a heavy accent, um it wouldn't. That auto-sync feature just would not line\\nup the text correctly. It has gotten so much better in the past year\\nas I said but, so sort of my backup method to that YouTube um auto transcribe, and edit\\nthat and auto-sync , is a free software app called AgeiSub. And it's free open-source software. You don't need an account. You just download this app onto your, either\\nyour pc or your Mac. And you open your video and then you can basically\\nfrom scratch add your captions to your video. [Phone rings] It's great for short videos\\num excuse me just a second it's great for shorter videos. [Phone rings buttons pushed] I didn't anticipate that phone ringing. Um and I, we have a video of me demonstrating\\nhow to add captions using this AgeiSub that I think Eileen's gonna play. And then if you have any questions we'll,\\nI'll come back after and I can answer them, but it's just a real introductory in how to\\ndo it, so let's just take a look. Eileen if you want to start that, Oh I, I'm sorry I, I guess I need to talk\\nthrough this a little bit so. [Eileen] - yeah that'll be great and then\\nit'll be the next slide. [Carrie]- Okay so AgeiSub, [Eileen]- just\\ncould I say the gray box that you'll see right now is just me muting myself and unmuting\\nmyself. [Carrie]- thank you uh so AgeiSub is just\\none of there's many resources that you can use to add captions to your videos. Another free one is called Subtitle Edit. Listed there is Jubler. Those are free. The one that I have found to be the most user-friendly\\nto just sort of get in there and do it is, AgeiSub. That's why I use that one. Then there's fee-based software that can get\\npretty pricey. Camtasia is one I think it's maybe around\\n$250 to purchase that. Um, Caption Tools is a website that's similar\\nto YouTube. It will auto transcribe something for you\\nand then it has an auto aligner that lines up your text. And I think they charge maybe a dollar a minute\\nto use their platform. Caption Maker and Mac Caption are um the same\\nsoftware one is for a pc one is for a Mac. And it, it ranges in price from $2,000 to\\n$15,000 so it's pretty pricey software. It's also I believe, video editing software. But those can be used to create captions. Um and when I say create captions I mean put\\nyour captions on your video and sync them and then be able to create the srt or the\\nvtt file that's used to display captions on a video. Then, of course, there's you know, if you,\\nthis presentation is sort of a do it yourself but there are resources to um just pay somebody\\nelse to do it for you. And probably the one that I have found that\\nis the cheapest and they, they offer a pretty quick turnaround time and they say they're\\n99% accurate is rev.com. I have not ever used them so I can't endorse\\nthem but if I was gonna pay to have a video um captioned I probably would start there\\njust because it seems to be the most bang for your buck. Um and just see what the quality is and then\\nof course you can pay um like your closed caption provider. If you have someone you use to do your real-time\\ncaptioning most providers can also provide offline captioning as well. So I see a couple questions let me just Bobby asks, “what language do they use?” Um, I'm not sure what you mean by that sorry. Maybe if you could clarify. Um, yes English. I'm not sure if they have translation options,\\nmeaning if you can take English text and translate it. I believe subtitle edit does have multiple\\nlanguage capabilities. I'm not sure about AgeiSub because I just\\nhave not tried that feature. I caption everything in English, but they\\ndo say that captions do benefit English language learners as well. Um but again everything I do is I, I'm I caption\\nin English. So and with that, Eileen I think we're ready\\nto watch the quick demo of how to use AgeiSub to add captions to your video. [Eileen]- All right! So can you hear me speaking [Carrie]- yes! [Eileen]- Thank you all right I just want\\nto make sure because my computer sound is connected to the video showing. [Video audio, Carrie speaks]- Okay this is\\ngoing to be a quick demonstration of how to create a srt file for a video with a free\\nopen source software called AgeiSub. I have already downloaded this app on my computer\\nbut I'm going to take you to their website so you can see where to get it. It's an open-source software. It's free so anytime you're downloading open-source free software just be very careful where you're downloading it from so that you're not downloading\\nsomething with a virus. On their website up here, AgeiSub it looks\\nlike it's this box right here that says latest version 3.2.1. So you can download it there onto your pc. It will run on a mac or a pc. It crashes on my mac when I run it on my mac. So I always run it on my pc [Mouse click} and I save often. So that's where you can download the app AgeiSub. I already have it on my computer so I'm going\\nto go to my file manager and find the video that I want to make captions for and open it in AgeiSub. So here's the video, this demonstration program. it's an mp3 mp4 file. I'm going to right-click on that and do an\\nopen with AgeiSub. That's going to open this video that I want\\nto make captions for and it opens it in AgeiSub. And a couple things here on the screen. Here's the video, over here are what I call\\nthe sound waves. I am not an AgeiSub expert there are lots\\nof tutorials online um they're not great. I think the best way to learn this is just\\nto sort of get in here and do it. So this is just going to be a quick demonstration\\nfor you how to do a video and then I would just encourage you to download AgeiSub and\\nget a short video and just kind of start playing with it. But over here are the sound waves. But this is going to allow us to highlight\\nchunks of the audio. And then down here we type the text [sound\\nof typing] that goes with that chunk of audio and then we'll commit it. When we get it how we want it, we'll commit\\nit and then that will show up over the video. It'll be time synced with the video where\\nyou want that text to appear. First thing I want to do is adjust some things \\nthat we can see. You can make the video bigger using these\\nbuttons here. So I'm going to get it to where you can see\\nthe video and then I want the text bigger so that you can actually see what the text\\nis going to look like. It's over here under this edit tab and we're\\ngoing to put it at about 40 and see if you can see it. And this is just how it's going to look in\\nAgeiSub that does, this does not affect how it's going to look in your srt file that you're\\ngoing to upload to say YouTube or Facebook. This is just how it's going to appear in AgeiSub\\nso that we can see it. [mouse click] So I think that's big enough. Everybody can see it and obviously that's\\nnot the correct text. [mouse click] We'll get it corrected here\\nin a moment. [mouse clicks through out] So you can play\\nthe video this way there's a little play button here, [Video audio]- Hello, this is Scout\\nwith Missouri Assistive Technology and I heard you were unaware. [Carrie]- but the way we're going to play\\nit so that we can highlight chunks of the audio to add text to it is, we're going to\\nuse these little sound waves over here. And there's a couple different views. [Mouse click] I think the easiest way to highlight\\nthe chunks is this view. And you can make these waves, you can spread\\nthem out or condense them. And I like to spread it out where you can\\nsee these little pauses. These are probably pauses in his dialogue. So you want to be able to see that clearly\\nso that you can select your chunks. So it looks to me like he probably starts\\ntalking right about here, and then it looks to me like there's probably a break in dialogue\\nhere, and there's probably a break in dialogue here. So let's just go ahead and select a chunk\\nof text. We're going to left click here, [mouse click]\\nwhich is going to put that red line where we're going to start. And then we're going to go over here and let's\\njust go ahead and select this little piece here and see how far he gets. So I'm going to left, excuse me, I’m going\\nto right click. I left clicked over here for the start for\\nthe red line. I'm going to right click right here [mouse\\nclick] and let's just play that chunk of audio and see what he says. [Video audio]- Hello! This is Scout. [Carrie]- Okay so that sounds like a good\\nbreak in text so. [typing] [Video audio]- Hello! This is Scout. [Carrie]- I think that sounds good so I'm\\ngoing to use this little check box right here to commit. It's kind of confusing because there's another\\ncheckbox down here and to be honest, I don't know what that is. [giggle] But just make sure you're using this\\none up here. It says commit any pending audio timing changes. [mouse click] So we're going to commit that\\nand then you'll see the software AgeiSub automatically goes ahead and highlights the next chunk for\\nyou. So here's another chunk of dialogue let's\\njust play it and see what it sounds like. [Video audio]- with Missouri Assistive Technology. [typing] [Carrie]- and that sounds like another good\\nspot there's a good break there in his dialogue so let's go ahead and commit that, and then it's going to go ahead and highlight the next chunk. Let's see what it's highlighted. [Video audio]- and I heard you were [typing] [Carrie]- I think we probably need to hear\\na little bit more before we break that section so this, this part's probably fine. I'm going to actually move it over just a\\nlittle bit for our start so I'm going to hit the left click [mouse click] here to, to drag\\nthat red line over. And I want to go over here and go see if I\\ncan find a break in his dialogue. I'm going to condense that a little bit so\\nwe can see a bigger chunk. Right over here it looks like a break in his\\ndialogue where he probably pauses so let's left-click over [mouse click] here. So now you can see the chunk I have highlighted\\nis between the red and the blue lines. Let's just listen to that. [Video audio]- and I heard you were unaware\\nof our device demonstration program. [typing] [Carrie]- and that sounds like a good break\\nin dialogue. And over here it looks like two lines of text\\nwhich is fine. I don't like to go any more than two lines\\nof text.  Up here you can see this little box shows how many characters are in that subtitle. I think it's recommended not to go over 52. I don't really pay attention to that I, I\\njust sort of try to keep it to one or two lines for readability. So let's play this chunk again. [Video audio]- and I heard you were unaware\\nof our device demonstration program. [Carrie]- I think that's a good break in his\\ndialogue. So let's go ahead and commit that section\\n[mouse click] and we'll see what AgeiSub, you can see it's selected this little part\\nhere. And I don't think that's going to be enough. I think we need to come over to where there's\\na bigger break in his dialogue. So the starting spot is probably fine but\\nI'm going to drag the end clear over to here where it looks like there's a pause in his\\nspeech. And I'm going to left-click there [mouse click]. So that gives me a little bit bigger chunk\\nthat's highlighted. Let's play that. [Video audio]- Well, let me tell you it exists\\nso that you can make an informed decision. [typing]\\n[Carrie]- Yep, I, I like that it's 58 characters. It looks like it's two lines I think that's\\nprobably fine. Um let's just play that chunk. [video audio]- Well let me tell you it exists\\nso that you can make an informed decision. [Carrie]- Yep I'm going to go ahead and commit\\nthat section. AgeiSub’s going to go ahead and highlight\\nthe next section. I, I think it's going to be need to be longer\\nthan that so I'm going to leave the starting spot fine where it is, but I'm going to go\\nover here and drag, I'm going to right-click [mouse click] here so that it makes our section\\na little bit bigger. And let's hear the dialogue. [Video audio]- about what assistive technology\\nis going to best support you or someone that you're helping. [typing] [typing] [Carrie]- Okay I'm going to commit that. And I'll let it jump to the next chunk again. I think our section here needs to be a little\\nbit longer so let's go over here to where it looks like there's a pause in dialogue\\nand right-click [mouse click] that. So our starting chunk is here, our ending\\nchunk is here. Let's play that. [Video audio]- So if you were going out to\\nbuy glasses, you wouldn't just pick a pair and decide they were right. [typing]\\n[Carrie]- I actually want to stop it right after he says, so if you were going out to\\nbuy glasses. So let's play this section again and we're\\ngoing to adjust this stopping point to where he ends “glasses’. [Video audio]- so if you were going out to\\nbuy glasses, you wouldn't just pick a pair and decide they were right, you. [typing]\\n[Carrie]- I know I moved this. I didn't want to move that so I'm going to\\nput it back. I'm going to right-click over here. I think is where he says glasses let's play\\nit. [Video audio]- so if you were going out to\\nbuy glasses, [Carrie]- Yep. So I'm going to commit that. So if you kind of get the idea of what I'm\\ndoing and then as we're doing that and committing those lines it's, it's coming down here with\\nthe text and making your time coded lines. So here's your line of text here's the time\\ncode that it has used to sync it up to your video. And then if you just sort of want to play\\nthe video and see how it looks you can play it down here. [Video audio]- you wouldn't just pick a pair\\nand decide. [Carrie]- if you select any of these lines\\nand I'm just using my mouse to select these, but I'm going to select this first line. And I want it to start there. so I just select this line and hit play and\\nit'll start. [Video audio]- Hello! This is Scout with Missouri Assistive Technology\\nand I heard you were unaware of our device demonstration program. Well, let me tell you it exists so that you\\ncan make an informed decision about what assistive technology is going to best support you or\\nsomeone that you're helping. So if you were going out to buy glasses, you\\nwouldn't just pick. [Carrie]- Okay so that's where we're at currently. I saw a typo in here so I want to go back\\nand fix this typo which is very easy to do. I'm just using my mouse and I'm going to click\\non this line. I need to capitalize this “a”. So any of my editing typing that I want to\\ndo, it needs to be done in this box up here. So I'm just simply going to make that a [typing]\\ncapitalized “a” and we're good to go. Now what I like to do in this because it,\\nit does crash on me occasionally way more often on my mac. It doesn't crash often on my pc, but I do\\nlike to save, save it often as I'm going. So I'm going to come up here to this save\\nicon [mouse click] click it and I'm just going to call it [typing] demonstration and it will\\nsave it in AgeiSub's format which is a dot ass file. When we're finished creating our entire caption, when we're done captioning the video we can save it and export it as an srt or a vtt\\nformat. So I actually have done the video completely already and I'm going to just go ahead I'm going to pretend we've already finished this. We've gone through all these chunks to the whole end and typed in our text here and committed each chunk. I'm just going to pretend we've already done that and I'm going to pull it up completed and just let you see what it looks like. [mouse click] I think this is the one that's\\nfinished open it in AgeiSub. I'm going to open the video that's associated with it. Make this a little bigger so you can see it\\nand I'll play it so you can see how those captions sync up. [Video audio]- Hello! This is Scout with Missouri Assistive Technology\\nand I heard you were unaware of our device demonstration program. Well, let me tell you it exists so that you\\ncan make an informed decision about what assistive technology is going to best support you or\\nsomeone that you're helping. So if you were going out to buy glasses you wouldn't just pick a pair and decide they were right without trying them on to make\\nsure they're a good fit. It's the same with assistive technology. Whether you're looking at educational apps, on an iPad, or higher low-tech vision devices, we have a variety of supports to help you\\ndecide what is going to work best. Anything from cause and effect communication,\\nto Braille devices, to mobility supports and anything in between. We are here, to help Missourians make an informed decision. So if you'd like to know more about this program please reach out to us at Missouri Assistive Technology you can find us at www.at.mo.gov [Carrie]- Okay so there's your video with\\nyour subtitles added. And what you're creating here is the actual\\nsubtitle file which is going to be then uploaded to whatever platform you have put your video on such as YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo. You're going to upload that srt file along\\nwith that video to those platforms. Sort of what they call a sidecar file, so it plays\\nside by side with the video. And you can export this if you need an srt. You do a file export um just kind of skip\\nthis first screen, click export and down here it shows you the supported formats. The most common format for Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube is an srt. Which is right here, subrip. So you want to save it as your subrip file\\nit's probably going to make me name it something else. [typing] And then I'm going to exit out of this and\\nthere's our demo subrip file. It's an srt file if you can see that and that's\\nwhat you would upload along with your video as your srt file to show captions. I'm going to also show you a different website\\nwhen I come back to the screen on how you convert an srt file to a different format. [Eileen]- Alright Carrie, I'll let you take\\nover this slide. [Carrie]- Okay I know that was a lot of information. Um like I said there's lots of tutorials that\\nyou can find on how to do that. I'm also happy to be a resource if you want\\nto use AgeiSub to caption something feel free to reach out to me and I can answer any questions. I'm going to try to pull up  [mouse click] this website it's a good website for file converting. It's called Subtitletools.com So I'm going to pull that up and then, Eileen,\\nI wonder if can I share my screen? [Eileen]- Yeah, you sure can. You should be able to do that. If you could um take just a couple minutes\\nto do that let's see do you know how to share your screen? [Carrie]- Yeah. [Eileen]- I'm gonna need to stop sharing so\\nthat you can take it. [Carrie]- Okay. Do you see that? [Eileen]- It says it's starting to share your\\nscreen yep there it is. [Carrie]- Okay so this is subtitle tools.com. It's a great converter or a file converter\\nsite so you can see here it says convert to srt so if you have, say you had something\\ncaptioned by a real-time captioner and they send you a dot scc file and you need that\\nconverted to an srt you can do that here. You can take an srt and convert it to the\\nweb vtt which I think Eileen can correct me if I'm wrong but I think youtube might like\\nthe vtt ,or maybe it was PowerPoint I'm not sure. [Eileen]- PowerPoint. [Carrie]- PowerPoint, okay. And then if you have an srt file that maybe\\na Captioner or somebody has sent you and you don't want the timings on it you just want a straight text file, this here gets you the option to do that as well so\\nboy I don't know if I have a text file here I'll just click this, [mouse click] you can\\nchoose your file it'll take you to your file manager. I'm not sure this might be a text file so\\nI can click that and ask it to convert it [mouse click] to an srt it converts it and\\nthen you can download it here to your computer. So that's just a good file converter if you\\nhave something in a format and you need a different format um for a different platform. So I'm going to stop sharing and look at the questions here. Luke asks, “what do we save it in?” When done so um I hope I answered that in the video.  AegiSub, it saves it as a dot ass file but you can export it as an srt. I don't believe it allows you to export a\\nvtt but you can use that website I just showed you to convert it to a different file format. And then there's a question about what is\\nmy email address and I think Eileen has a slide at the end of this presentation that\\nshows my contact information. Feel free to reach out. As we watch that video you can see that we had it captioned, open caption. And we utilized YouTube's auto captioning\\nfor that and I went in and just edited it and there are some things I definitely would tweak. Like I would pull it into AegiSub and tweak\\nsome things so that each speaker id starts on its own new line and that the environmental sounds are on it's own line. So that AegiSub just sort of gives you a little bit more control over tweaking your timings and the way things are going to appear. So I think that's it from, from my demo. So I'll throw it back over to you Eileen to\\ngo through the YouTube and Facebook methods. [Eileen]-  Great. Thank you so much Carrie, um All right, so that is the um the ultimate\\ncaptioning tool that's free, that you can customize, um and that you know has a lot\\nmore flexibility for perfecting your transcript and final outcome. But you might not have access to that yet. You might have some other tools that you can use. YouTube we've already referred to a couple of times is a definite resource.  If you have an account or want to open one it's free It offers four different ways for you to do\\ncaptions and I will walk you through a couple of them. One is if you have the srt file already made\\nlike for example it's um like this type of deal that we're doing right here for you is\\na meeting that's going to be recorded,  that's captioned, and the outcome of that is that\\ncaptioner will provide me with a transcript. So then I can upload the recording of this\\nwebinar with that transcript to YouTube simultaneously as a sidecar file. And what's nice about YouTube is you can go in and edit that! And I'll show you. You can also use the auto-generated captioning function on YouTube. You have to specify language. I think Luke asked that question. YouTube has a ton of languages to choose from. It should be what the video is in. You can also add other translations to go\\nalong with that. So that's kind of a nice feature. With YouTube. You can also manually type it in or you can\\ncopy and paste. If you just have the, the transcript itself\\njust the words without timing assigned you can copy and paste that into the subtitles\\nsection and I'll briefly show you that where you would do that. The big bonus with YouTube is that the end result is: you can produce a transcript that could either be the vtt file or the srt file. That's what Carrie had mentioned. The vtt file is what you just observed having been inserted into a PowerPoint file with the video.  That's what you just watched. So it is open caption, so it's, it's um it's\\nin place in one location for the video. Now with Facebook, if you have a Facebook page, you are also able to caption a video file that you upload. And it is not, it's not as sophisticated\\nas YouTube and you're not going to produce an outcome of a transcript, but if you have\\na transcript or if you want to use auto-generated captionings, you can, you can caption your\\nvideo. And with, again with Facebook as YouTube you have to specify the language. And I'll show you where that is. If you upload an srt file uh transcript to\\nyour, with your Facebook video, you have to name it specifically the traditional way that\\nan srt file is named. And I have that here on the screen in yellow. It would be the file name, dot, and then the\\nlanguage and county uh country code. So it's going to be for English and USA, it's\\ngoing to be file name, dot, small letters en, underscore, capital letters US. And they also offer an option to manually\\ntype in transcripts. I can tell you it's again, it's not as fluid\\nas YouTube. So I wouldn't recommend you spend a lot of time doing edits in here. But most, most likely my experience I can\\nshare with you has been with Facebook and YouTube that it's been fairly accurate. It's picked up the words um properly, not\\na lot of mispronunciations and that it has also got the timing assigned very, very accurately. So I'm really impressed with how these two platforms have improved over time. I've worked with YouTube for several years. At the beginning when I started working with it, it would crash on you, and now you can walk away from it not having saved it, and\\ncome back to it and it's still there. So there's so much improvement that's gone on. Um let's see one last thing before I move\\non and I'm going to give you a demonstration of these two, is with Facebook. If you can't see the captions or somebody\\nthat's watching your video that you captioned is saying that, it's most likely because the\\ncaptioning option has not been set up in the personal account. And so in my next screen here on the PowerPoint\\ni'm going to show you what that looks like. You would have to go into the personal account that person or if it's your account. You can't see it go into the settings function and there's usually a long list on the left hand side at the very bottom would\\nbe video settings and when you select that this is a screen you see and you would select the always show captions option. It's got a toggle button it's either on or\\noff. So make sure it's turned on. And you can also control the visibility of\\nyour captions with the contrast so it can be black and white or gray and white would be some options you might have to select from. So a little bit there, flexibility that's\\nbeen there for many years but if this is something that you get a, a question on then you know this is advice you can give them. All right, so I'm going to now stop sharing\\nthe PowerPoint and move on to uh showing you YouTube and Facebook. And this is, I'm probably going to go a little\\nbit longer than an hour so um if any of you need to leave, I understand but um there is\\ngoing to be a raffle if you can hang on at the end! Those that are here will be able to benefit\\nfrom participating in that. One lucky winner will win a robotic pet! So okay, so this is um a YouTube channel. This is our YouTube channel at Missouri Assistive Technology. And um how would you go about uploading a video and captioning it? And that's what I want to show you now. There's two ways you can do that. You can go into the manage videos tab which is over here. I like to go through the studio to do this. And so it's the little profile picture on\\nyour YouTube page. You click that with, I'm using a left-click\\nbutton and I'm selecting YouTube studio and it takes you to the dashboard. So it's kind of the main area of the studio. And you would upload a video up here in the top right-hand corner. It's a little icon that's a up arrow with\\na line under it. Um, over time the platforms change so the location might be different but the concept is going to be the same. You just need to find how you upload a video and you're going to select the video file. And here I'm going to select this video and\\nit's going to upload. And so with YouTube, it goes through several processes. It uploads. It checks for HD compatibility high quality\\ncompatibility. It also checks for copyright. So while it's doing that you have, you can\\nfill out the details of your video. You can give it a title, you can fill out\\nthe description someone will see about the video, thumbnails will be produced you can select that for what they see, and so forth. And for the purpose of our demonstration,\\nI'm going to move past all of that. There's two things you have to do on this\\nsection. One is you have to say if the video is made\\nfor kids or not. And ours is not specifically made for kids. I'll mark no. If you don't mark that you can't move past\\ninto the next section so that's why it's important to know you have to mark that. Now in the “show more section” this is\\na link you open that more things expand. And down here is the language option. This is where you'd have to select the language your video is in. This is a recent change actually that YouTube has made in terms of that it's automatically assuming that your video is in English because we already, I'm assuming that because we already have an account and we have most of our videos in English or by the location of our address. This is what they're assuming.  If you don't\\nhave that populate, YOU have to select some language and so there's a variety. There's a scroll bar here you can see, there's a ton of languages we um, we'll use English United States. And so those are the two things here you have to do and then you can move on to the next screen. You also have a toggling option up here there's always more than one way to get somewhere right? But for the demonstration, I'll probably\\nkind of show you how I do it. Now um in this screen since the video has\\nalready been uploaded even though it's still processing stuff, you can add your subtitles here! This is a new feature that they've added. And so if you have that srt file you can upload it here. The auto-sync option is, if you have the text but you don't have timing assigned so you can copy and paste it in there. You can do that um I think of an example that might work is if somebody has a script that the speaker followed specifically and there\\nis no other like no background sounds or anything so purely is what's um the audio of the of\\nthe video, then you can copy and paste it in there. And then work with the YouTube to assign timings and that there's a processing period that, that occurs you have to come back later and check your timing and see if it's done. Same thing with typing it in manually that\\nwould be another option. Now I'm not going to go into each of those\\nthings. I'm going to now show you this option to upload the file for it would be an srt format and you're going to select the timing with an\\nsrt. Usually there is usually timing assigned so\\nwe're going to I'm assuming there's usually timing assigned. We're going to select continue, and I'm going to grab that file and name that with the language code there. And it will automatically populate into the\\nsection that shows the timing breakdown and so you've got the captions of your text here in the caption boxes and you have the timing assigned over here. And this is really nice because you can manually change the numbers if you need to. You always want to make sure that the ending time block um here it says:06.07 um that's I think that's seconds and\\nnanoseconds {correction milliseconds} that, that flows into the beginning of the next\\ncaption otherwise they'll overlap. So here you see it can be the same actual\\nseries of numbers um or it could be slightly later in the time on the, on the beginning\\nof the next caption. So that's a little bit about this orientation. There's a trash can right here and that is\\nvery sensitive trash can. I can tell you from experience if your mouse hovers over that and you accidentally touch that mouse, you will delete that caption and you will have to re-enter it so just be aware that that trash can is definitely there to do its job. [giggle] So stay away from it. Um you also can play the video. Here's a play button and um while you're checking your captions and the timing you can listen along, You, this is a nice little gift they\\ngive you. It's a pause while you're typing and um so\\nyou would just click on in the middle of the box there and so as you're typing in the captioning it will pause. You just need to hit play again to get going. And then YouTube also offers you keyboard shortcuts. You click on this link and it pops up some\\noptions. So if you're used to using keyboard shortcuts to get around um and, and make things easier and that's what would work here in their YouTube studio. Down below is the sound bites and the transcript as it travels across that. It is um not as sophisticated looking as AgeiSub! It's very tiny. It doesn't usually get any larger than what\\nyou're seeing here. Um frankly, I don't spend any time looking\\nat that because this is really functional on the top section. Um and so that's what I work with. Now if you wanted to first look at the text\\nof your transcript, you would toggle into that. Let me go back and see what it was called,\\n“edit as text ” And honestly when you use the other options this is the first box\\nthat pops up. The other options of auto-generated captioning\\nand typing in your own, this is the first box you'll see. Um so it's just a pure box of text and you\\ncan come in and edit anything that needs to be done so that's people's names, organization\\nspelling of their names, mispronunciation of words, these are all kinds of things you\\ncan visually scan for and pick up easily without having to play the video. And then also websites. See down at the bottom we have a website name\\nhere since this caption was already done and edited um it's, it's not a concern. What you do see here though, like, I use Grammarly, the Chrome app to catch grammar and spelling errors, and so it's highlighted that for me\\nas an area of change need. I would only change that if, if it matches\\nwhat the person said otherwise you leave it alone. But it's nice to have that visual check to\\nsee do I need to look at something there? So, so that's a little bit about that you\\ncan spend time editing in here in the text box or toggle back over to edit timing or\\nyou can make changes in here. One thing I want to show you is that you can see how the words are kind of spread out over three lines. And assistive is all by itself over there. Um you can use the delete key once to move the line below it up. So I would put my cursor behind the word “assistive.” I think I have a, there's a space right there\\nso I'd leave a space and then hit delete. And then it moves that lineup. So it just tightens things up a little bit. You can feel comfortable doing that I don't\\nmess much more with anything in this area because when it plays it's actually it may\\nlook slightly different this is a condensed size of the screen. When you are ready to take a break from this or you're done you can either save it or you can select done. I'm going to just cancel out of this right\\nnow and show you a little bit more about where we're at. So I'm taking you back to, we've uploaded\\nthe video. You would also need to move through the next couple screens. The next screen is just knowing that they've checked for copyright issues and if you own the video there should never be a concern\\non that um and then the last piece is visibility. When you're setting up the video I select\\num private when I'm working on captions because until it's ready to be published it's not\\nready for prime time viewing as far as I'm concerned.  And you can change that. So, I would save that here and so now you wonder where did the video go? [giggles] It went to the content list of all the other videos that are uploaded and so over here on the left side is kind of a, a toggle option to get to see all your\\nvideos. And when you have finished your captions and you want to change the private status you would, you could do it right here. Here's our video and there's a little down\\narrow you can select that and, and make it public. So that way you'll always be able to then\\nproduce you know your final end result. Now I've done a couple of um other pre-recorded or I've uploaded some of the same video because I want to show you the status. So with auto-generated captioning it takes\\na while for YouTube to generate that caption for you. So right now as I've uploaded this video and I've saved it, the auto-generated request has been placed and so at some point it will be completed. It can take a couple of hours or maybe the\\nnext day. So if you choose to use auto-generated captioning in YouTube, plan on uploading it before you're actually going to do the work. Let me show you what it looks like so you\\nknow in the subtitle section of that video if it's ready or not. So I'm going to click on what we just uploaded and I'm going to scroll through here and this is all the details about the video. The subtitle page is right here so there'll\\nbe a couple of different line items. This line right here tells you that you've\\njust uploaded the video. That there's no subtitles that have been completed yet because we're going to do the auto-generated function If you'd have added the transcript that would have been different so let's go to a video that's been uploaded for a while which is\\nthis one. And let's go to the subtitle page. For that one, it's been in for a couple of\\ndays. This is what it would look like next when\\nthe auto-generated captioning has been produced for you. It says published automatic that means the auto-generated captions are available for you to edit and this is the link that you\\nwould click to get to that. And so see how it takes you to the text box? And so this is the unedited version of what you just looked at. So we would need to go in and make those changes for spelling, and if the website needed to be done differently in any you know words\\nthat are mispronounced, and you could also toggle into the timing and do it in there. So I'm going to cancel out of that because\\nI'm just showing you the stages of what you would see after the auto-generated is ready once you have I'm going to now, go to a video that's had the captions completed for the\\nsame video, and um we've got all the details ready to go on this detail page. We're going to go to the subtitles and it\\nhas been um edited by me so it's in a draft form because I saved it as a draft. And I can either go back and continue to edit it or I can publish it and that's what I'm going to do now because I know it's ready\\nto go. And um it is published. And so see where it says right there published by creator? So here is the um the whole purpose of doing it! If you are going to now upload it to Facebook.\\nis go to these three little dots and open those options. And here will be the download for the transcript and when you select that you get to pick which file format you want. And if you select the srt it's going to go\\nto your download folder. And I would recommend that this, (this is\\nhow I do it), if it saves you time in tasks is, go into your download folder and just\\nrename it! It's going to be named captions and you can just rename it whatever the file is. Like here it's reuse dot your language code. So dot en small letters, underscore. capital U capital S. And so then it's named\\nand it's ready to go for you to upload to Facebook. So I'm going to move into Facebook and show you how that might work. Here is our Facebook page and with Facebook, they have a manage tool function. If you're the administrator you can see these tools over here on the left and you would scroll down to publishing tools. And it takes a second for it to open. And what we're getting to is the Creator Studio. So both YouTube and Facebook use this term studio. And you're going to select oops sorry you're going to select Creator Studio and it will open up to where you can create posts. And there's always two ways you can do something right? You can create your post here and attach the video or you can go up to this create new button and I've just, it seems like it's it\\ntakes out one step of tasks you have to do if you go the other way. So this is kind of what I've been doing. I go to create new up here at the left, left-hand corner and it opens up options for you to, to add things I'm going to upload the video\\nand let's select our reuse program video. And it'll take a second. It'll open a whole new page and I'm going\\nto take away that message, um so here we have kind of similar to what we saw with YouTube. There's a detail page where you're going to\\nwrite out all the details about your video. So we're going to call it reuse So that's the title that will show when it's\\nfinally published. Now this section where the icon is, is actually your content of the video like you would create a regular post [sound of typing] and so you just type whatever it is you'd\\nlike to do uh have on your I'm sorry what you would like to have on your content. And uh gives you options to, a box there for you to place tags if you use tags on your Facebook post. Now here is the thumbnail of the video that it's uploaded and you will want to select the language. Here. This is the spot. So you would tap on that option and it gives\\nyou an edit box and if you just start typing your language it'll automatically guess what it is that you want. So, I'm going to select English and so it's,\\nit's assigned. So I don't have to worry anymore about that. This “edit video” over here has um as\\nfar as I know, nothing to do with access. It's just like trimming it and so forth. If you um, for both Facebook and for YouTube, if you need to edit your video do that outside of this whole captioning process you would want to caption your final version um that would be a big tip I would give to you. If that is something you're responsible for\\ndoing, all of that, use, you can use whatever tools you use to edit. If you use YouTube that's fine. And then save it, download the edited version and THEN upload the edited version and caption that. If that's helpful for you. So all right so here on Facebook you would um now move over to the right-hand side there's um we're on the video details page, we're\\ngoing to go to the captions page. And we're going to click this option on. I'm going to, so I'm going to turn this off\\nhere, well actually no. I'm not. I'm going to show you um I'm going to show you the auto-generated function so here you have a choice to do auto-generated captions and you, it asks you if you um want a chance to review it before it sends it out and so\\nyes, I do. And you can have another choice here to upload your transcript or you can write your own while you listen to oh you can type it out\\nwhile you listen. Um so auto-generated captions looks like this. You've got your status bar at the bottom. It shows the video has been uploaded. It shows the captions have been generated. It also has a section where it says added\\ncaptions here and this gives us a rating of the accuracy of its caption. And it's a high rating. There's a couple things that go into it getting\\nthat type of accuracy. One is the, the speaker's pronunciation, their pace if they pause, those things make it more successful. The quality of the sound makes it more successful. So if you are working with an individual that is doing, is presenting in the video that, that has less than a quality sound or the\\npronunciation of words is not clear, you might want to work in YouTube to upload your video and caption it that way. That way you have more control over your editing tools. Facebook really isn't um good for that. So all right well just a little bit about\\nthat. And then here is the option to go in and review the captions and so this is what it looks like for the auto-generated captioning. if\\nyou choose that option and you definitely would want to go in and edit that. So you have the viewing option of the video over here on the left. And all the captions have already been broken out into the caption chunks in the text boxes and they've already assigned timing to it. You can adjust the timing by selecting this\\noption here. And you can use the numerical changes. It's just a guess though because there's no\\nway for you to see that timeline. There's no sound, uh sound waves down here for you to watch so that's what I'm saying it's it's not um it's not as sophisticated\\nobviously as the one that Carrie showed you with AgeiSub or even YouTube. I think YouTube has a little bit more control. Um but it really does a really good job. Like what I will tell you is um obvious spellings they got Scout's name spelled correctly but only part of our agency's name is um capitalized. And then down at the bottom there's another scroll bar here you have to grab to scroll all the way down, is website names. So a url address could be spelled out literally as it's pronounced so when Scout said dot in there and so it's spelled out d-o-t and\\num [Typing] we want them to come to Missouri Assistive Technology and not the Department of Transportation. So I would change that and I would take it\\noff of breaking it up over 2 text boxes. So, so that's a little bit about how you can\\nedit that and, and then play it and let's go ahead and play this. [Video audio]- Hello! This is Scout from Missouri Assistive Technology\\nand it is almost earth day. And that's a great time to think about how\\nwe can reduce, reuse, and recycle. [Eileen]- So a couple things here you don't\\nsee the captioning shown and um you don't know that it's scrolling through there. And there may be something about these {arrows} up here that I haven't explored yet. I'm still learning how to use this properly. But for this orientation at least you get\\nin there and see what it looks like and I'll give you a chance to learn how to to do those details. I'm going to cancel out of this. I'm not going to save it because I'm going\\nto take one last step to show you how to upload it with an actual transcript. So we're going to go back here.  We're going to create it as new. I'm going to select the file and um since\\nwe have the, I'm going to scoot over here real quick and turn off the auto-generated\\ncaptions because I want to show you how to upload the actual transcript itself. And this will become an actual Facebook post here so [typing sounds] and that's the sound of me typing [giggles]\\nall right so, um Scout Merry's going to share a little bit about our reuse program. All right and then we're going to remember\\nselect the language here. And it's going to be English. And now we're going to go to the captions\\noption on the right-hand side and I'm going to select upload the srt file. And I've already got it renamed since um it\\nwas renamed in the download folder. I just moved it over for here today and, and\\ninto another folder and it's instantaneous. So I don't know if you notice the difference\\nbut remember I mentioned with YouTube like the auto-generated, there's a long delay um with getting that completed for you before you can get in there and work on it. With Facebook did you see that difference\\nwith the auto-generated? What I just demonstrated for you was instantaneous. Really took no more than um under probably 30 seconds. And with the transcript it's instantaneous. So I'm really impressed with how Facebook has done that. Now this is what it looks like when you open it up and you've inserted your srt transcript. So remember it's a sidecar file so it just\\ngrabs everything that's on there including the timing that's why it's probably instantaneous. And the video player now shows here slightly differently. It has the timing and the words shown as it would scroll through. Before I show you this and play it, you would tap into the text box underneath the timing section because as soon as I tap on that,\\nit's going to start playing. And then it'll stop. And you can jump to each one of these text boxes here down at the bottom of the video. So let me show you how that works. [Video audio]- Hello! This is Scout from Missouri Assistive Technology and it is almost earth day. [Eileen]- And so the timing um if you need\\nslight adjustments you can nudge it right or left with your mouse. Moving these text boxes over if for some reason the timing is slightly off or you can change the numbers um adjust the numbers over here by clicking on the actual uh timing the beginning and the end of the captions. However, if it's an uploaded transcript, it\\nshould be pretty on spot. You shouldn't have to really mess with it\\nbut it's always good to play it and watch and make sure. I have already reviewed that so we don't need to make any changes. So I'm going to cancel out of that because\\noh, exit without changing nope, I'm going to save it. I must have done something it thought was\\na change. [giggle] All right so that's um ready to go. So we're gonna move on to publishing this\\nso you would hit the next box and you get a couple of options. To publish it now; to schedule it; or save\\nit as a draft. So we're just going to go ahead and publish it now and I'm going to hit that button and it should take a second here to it'll tell\\nus the videos processing. It takes you to that creator studio and if\\nwe go to the video section it should be published or in the midst of doing that. So, so that is a little bit about Facebook\\nand how to use their auto-generated option for captions as well as uploading a transcript. So I'm going to stop sharing my screen here and go back to the PowerPoint. I know I covered a lot very quickly, but I'm\\ntrying to stay close to the time for ya. [Carrie] - Eileen, we do have a question in\\nthe chat box. [Eileen] -oh okay! [Carrie]- Claudia asks, “if you've already\\ncaptioned the video in YouTube what would be the advantage of creating the captions\\nagain in Facebook versus sharing the youtube video?” [Eileen]- That's a good question, I mean both get to it being accessible because the [YouTube] link takes the individual to your channel\\nwhere you've already done the captions so that's fine. It is just a matter of preference if you want\\nto upload your video if you own the file and you want to upload it as an individual post. This is just a way to ensure that you have\\nthe ability to caption it. And you can use your YouTube account to, to pull down that srt transcript and then attach it to the video file in Facebook so it's just\\nanother way to ensure that the that video that you are using separately as a post on\\nFacebook is captioned. [Carrie]- And I might just jump in real quick\\nhere and just um so basically we've shown you three different ways to do the same thing today right so um we're getting to the same end point no matter which method you use to get there. So yes, if you've captioned a video in YouTube. I think what we were hoping to demonstrate is that you can then take that same caption file that you've created in YouTube and upload it to your Facebook if you post your video also to Facebook or even to Vimeo. And even if they require different file types\\nfor those caption files you can use either the file converter website that I showed or\\nthe methods that Eileen demonstrated to convert those files to the preferred format. Um and I would just also point out, I think\\nit's worth mentioning again I think Eileen said but if you use the auto-generated captions from YouTube or Facebook there is definitely some value and benefit into using those. But just make sure that they're edited before you would publish those. You want to just read through and make sure that you've added the punctuation, that you've added speaker ids, that words have been capitalized, um and then add the environmental sounds. So that your, your viewers who might be deaf or English language learners can um you know um if there's music playing or if there's\\na phone ringing or if there's a dog barking that you add those. Because the auto-generated is not going to create those. And then just also something from if you have an event, real-time caption you can request from your caption provider that they send\\nyou that caption file either as a text that you can also use that to create your captions for your offline videos um your caption provider can send you a text file if they know in advance they can create an srt file for you. That is something I have to know in advance that you want in srt because I write differently, I caption things in shorter lines. I break them up into shorter lines as I'm\\ncaptioning real-time if I know that they're going to be uploaded as an srt afterwards. But your real-time caption provider can also be a resource for providing you that so that you don't have to type that text out yourself or rely on the auto-generated text um to be used for your offline videos. [Eileen]- Thank you Carrie. And I want to thank you for being here Carrie because this is away from your normal days duties and to have your input on this task\\nis so important and valuable so thank you for being here. And here is contact information if you do\\nwant to reach out to Carrie learn more about her services. And she works with a lot of state agencies\\nso she may or may not be familiar to you. But there's her phone number and her email address. I also want to acknowledge the special appearance by Scout Merry. He's one of our program coordinators and I want to thank him because he made those two videos that we use today specifically for\\nthis project and it also is a great way to learn about the programs that he manages so thank you! Now we're going to do a couple things here real quick.\", metadata={'source': 'kd7lmRzys1w'})]"
