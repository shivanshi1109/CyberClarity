    "\"\\nThe text is a transcript of a video showing two friends, Luke and Ashley, attempting to survive for 24 hours in the snow. They arrive at their destination and realize they have left their car keys behind, but decide to proceed without them. They begin building a shelter, but struggle with the process due to the difficulty of the terrain and Luke's lack of motivation. They also encounter challenges in finding firewood and water. Throughout the process, they assess their primitive survival ratings (PSRs) and make jokes about each other's weaknesses. Eventually, they finish building their shelter and manage to make a fire, but are interrupted by the arrival of the police, who tell them they are trespassing on private property. They quickly pack up and leave, feeling relieved that they had only intended to stay for a short time. Overall, the text depicts the friends' struggles and camaraderie as they attempt to survive in the wilderness.\""
